Setup crazyflie

1. Unpacking the Crazyflie
The Crazyflie 2.X box contains the following items. Make sure that you have all of them before you start assembling.

package contents
1 x Crazyflie 2.X control board with all components mounted
5 x CW propellers
5 x CCW propellers
6 x Motor mounts
1 x LiPo battery (240mAh)

1 x Battery holder expansion board
1 x USB cable (only with the Crazyflie 2.1)



2. Testing
The Crazyflie 2.X is tested extensively when produced, but to make sure nothing has happened during shipping/storage you should run the tests before starting the assembly. Power on the Crazyflie 2.X using a USB source (either computer or charger) and check the results of the test below. Note that it’s important to hold the Crazyflie 2.X steady during the test and away from strong magnetic sources.
